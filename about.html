<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I have been devoted to being a data scientist and experienced in interdisciplinary research in computer science. 
Interested in programable data collection, process and analysis, machine learning and natural language processing. 
Experienced in application development.</p>


<h2> Internship experience </h2>
<h3> 05/2015 -- 09/2105, Big Data and Visual Analytics Lab Internship, Big Data and Visual Analytics Lab, researcher </h3>
<p> During three-month research, at the beginning, we built a big data architecture for social media data mining and novelty event detection. Then, we conducted following research:
<ul>
<li> Collecting health-related data from social media websites (Twitter, Weibo). </li>
<li> Conducting data pre-processing and cleaning work. </li>
<li> Conducting data analysis (including keywords, sentiments, numerical analysis) using machine learning technology. </li>
<li> Visualizing Big Data with specific tools. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Projects </h2>
<h3> 09/2015 -- Present, Natural language processing based on machine learning, coresearcher </h3>
<ul> 
<li> Based on the LSI and incremental TF-IDF combing with clustering algorithms to realize real-time first story detection. </li>
<li>Based on the state-of-the-art word embeddings (word2vec), earth mover's distance and several optimized algorithms including LSH, LDA, SVM to realize high retrieval accuracy and improve the performance of first story detection. </li>
<li>Applying for a paper in Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016) international conference. </li>

<h3> 01/2016 -- Present, Scientific note-taking app development}{team leader, scrum master </h3>
<ul> 	<li> Product description:
	<ul>
		<li> Base on MEAN stack and node-webkit technique </li>
		<li> Monitor and record users' activity data for data analysis and mining to find a scientific way of taking notes </li>
		<li> Base on machine learning and NLP algorithms to classify notes to build a university ranged but major or topic specific knowledge database </li>
		<li> Build a user-friendly notes and knowledge sharing environment to facilitate and manage innovation and organisational learning </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li> Embraced and promoted the spirit of open-source. </li>
	<li> Efficiently led the development team to complete a full cycle of the software engineering process.</li>
	<li> Acquired the experience of being a MEAN full-stack developer.</li>
	<li> Highly understood the conflict and change management.</li>
	<li> Highly developed the understanding in the agile development.</li>
</ul>
