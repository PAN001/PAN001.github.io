<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I have been devoted to being a data scientist and experienced in interdisciplinary research in computer science. 
Interested in programable data collection, process and analysis, machine learning and natural language processing. 
Experienced in application development.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2> Internship experience </h2>
<h3> 05/2015 -- 09/2105, Big Data and Visual Analytics Lab Internship, Big Data and Visual Analytics Lab, researcher </h3>
<p> During three-month research, at the beginning, we built a big data architecture for social media data mining and novelty event detection. Then, we conducted following research:
<ul>
<li> Collecting health-related data from social media websites (Twitter, Weibo). </li>
<li> Conducting data pre-processing and cleaning work. </li>
<li> Conducting data analysis (including keywords, sentiments, numerical analysis) using machine learning technology. </li>
<li> Visualizing Big Data with specific tools. </li>
</ul>
